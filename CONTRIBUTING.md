# Contributing to Hello Counter App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (ESLint + Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Include tests for new features

## Testing

- Run `npm run test:run` to run all tests
- Add tests for any new functionality
- Maintain 100% test coverage when possible

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Before creating one:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Check if someone has already requested it
3. Describe the feature in detail
4. Explain why it would be useful
